ImportError: Failed to load PyTorch C extensions:
    It appears that PyTorch has loaded the `torch/_C` folder
    of the PyTorch repository rather than the C extensions which
    are expected in the `torch._C` namespace. This can occur when
    using the `install` workflow. e.g.
        $ python setup.py install && python -c "import torch"

    This error can generally be solved using the `develop` workflow
        $ python setup.py develop && python -c "import torch"  # This should succeed
    or by running Python from a different directory.
Data generation script finished.
